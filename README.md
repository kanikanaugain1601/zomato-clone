Here’s a simple version of the instructions:

1. `npm start`: 
   - Runs your app so you can see it while you're developing.
   - Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to view the app.
   - If you make changes, the page will automatically update.
   - Any errors or warnings will show in the console.

2. `npm test`: 
   - Runs the test checker in an interactive mode.
   - This helps you check if your app is working correctly.

3. `npm run build`: 
   - Prepares your app for production (the final version to go live).
   - It makes the app smaller and faster, putting the files into a `build` folder.
   - The filenames include hashes (random characters) to ensure the newest files are used.

4. `npm run eject`: 
   - This gives you full control over the configuration files (like webpack, Babel, etc.).
   - Be careful! Once you eject, you can’t undo it.
   - You only need this if you want to deeply customize the app's setup. For most projects, you don’t have to eject.
